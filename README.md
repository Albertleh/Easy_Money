Gambling is dumb !

The method:

Basically gambling :D

This is called the Martin Gale strtategy and it's about 220 Years old.

It's very simple: You play roulette and start by making a low bet f.e: 5$
If you win, you do it again. If you loose, you bet twice as much as
you did the previous round ->10$
If you loose again then double up again until you hit. Then the process
starts all over again. Then you should end up with a pile of cash on your
balance after a few hundred rounds. Depending on your financial situation I simulated this method
for every price point 5000 times and printed the average chance of making
profit. If you still want a high winning chance but you're broke then lower your initial
bet. This will take longer, but it is still as promising.
